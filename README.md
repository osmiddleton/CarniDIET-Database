# CarniDIET: A global database of terrestrial carnivore diets
The curiosity of humanity, and scientists specifically, with the natural world has resulted in a surplus of data spread throughout the literature and various archives. Compiling such  data in a standardised way for us in future research and conservation is vital for ensuring these valuable resources of knowledge are continued to be used in the future.

# Our aim?
To collate such widespread data for the purpose of conservation, and to  act as a central database for storing quantitative data on the dietary composition of terrestrial carnivores from a variety of sources (although Version 1.0 currently consists primarily of peer-reviewed scientific papers). However, in the future we aim to build on this to incorporate (1) more species and (2) from more types of sources.

As with any form of data collection, we are aware there will be likely errors within  the database. To ensure we build an accurate and precise database that best reflects reported data from the primary sources, we encourage users to keep note of any transcription errors that occurred in the database and update us by contacting Owen Middleton. 

# Versions
# 1.0: CarniDIET (05/06/2020)
*Publication: TBC*

Version 1.0 consists of quantitative data on the dietary composition of 104 species of carnivorous mammals* from (mostly) peer-reviewed scientific papers.

Sources of carnivorous mammal diets can mostly be found on the public Mendeley group "CarniDIET 1.0": https://www.mendeley.com/community/carnidiet-1.0/. This public group will also be updated as the database is updated in the future.

*Primarily consume mammals as a food type [MammalDIET: Kissling et al. (2014)].

# Future updates
Including papers for 104 mammal-consumer species published since March 2019.

Including further species not included in MammalDIET:
  - Dingos (Canis dingo)
  - Feral cats (Felis catus)
  
Including further search criteria in WoS searches.
 
Including further databases in searches (Zoological Records).
