# CarniDIET: A database of the diets of terrestrial, carnivorous mammals
The behaviour of carnivores within the world's ecosystems have been a hot topic of research for years. One such facet of their behaviour that has been heavily studied is that of their feeding behaviours, including the composition of a species' diet. In other words, the study of what individuals from the same species eat over a given unit of space and time.


# Aim
The curiosity of humans with the natural world has resulted in a surplus of valuable ecological data spread throughout the literature and various archives. While just the tip of the data-iceburg, we aim to compile these treasure troves of data that quantify species' diets at given points in space and time in a standardised way for use in future macroevolutionary, macroecological, and conservation research.

We want CarniDIET to act as a central database for storing quantitative data on the dietary composition of, for now, carnivorous mammals from a variety of sources (Version 1.0 currently consists primarily of peer-reviewed scientific papers). However, in the future we aim to build on this to incorporate (1) more species, including ideally beyond mammals, and (2) from more types of sources.

As with any form of data collection, we are aware there will be likely errors within  the database. To ensure we build an accurate and precise database that best reflects reported data from the primary sources, we encourage users to keep note of any transcription errors that occurred in the database and record these in the following Google Sheets document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EQlCOael5m_G5WYPw_pkz94O--iFxxhgYEobbHVyM7U/edit?usp=sharing, or directly contacting Owen Middleton.

*We will soon be providing a Shiny app to explore the database interactively.*


# Versions
# 1.0: CarniDIET (08/08/2020)
*Publication: TBC*

Version 1.0 consists of quantitative data on the dietary composition of 103 species of carnivorous mammals* from (mostly) peer-reviewed scientific papers.
*Primarily consume mammals as a food type [MammalDIET: Kissling et al. (2014)].

# Future updates
- Papers for 103 mammal-consumer species published since March 2019.

- Any missing diet records in sources in CarniDIET.

- Including further species not included in MammalDIET:
    - Dingos (Canis dingo)
    - Feral cats (Felis catus)
  
-Including further search criteria in WoS searches.
 
-Including further databases in searches (Zoological Records).
